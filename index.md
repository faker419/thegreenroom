# 2.0 Architecture Layout

## 2.1  Modular Design
-------------

The baseline design resulted in 5 warehouses that each measures 75 m by 35 m . 4 of which are cultivation modules, with a singular central convergance warehouse acting as the hub. each cultivation module is divided into two general areas: the core and the 
production area separated by decontamination airlock.
Each of the modules measures 6 m floor-to-ceiling. The 
overall footprint of the projects is 13,125 mÃ‚Â².

## 2.2 Central Hub Description 
-------------

The central hub area comprises of the main entrance, a room for staff, the fresh water unit and 
storage tank, the main control room for all the modules and the main decontamination airlock. The 
main airlock also contains the changing and decontamination rooms for employees which provides 
the first level of separation between the cultivation area and any contaminants from the outside or 
core areas 

There are 10 cold storage rooms, each one 5 m by 4 m, located in the middle of the central hub floor, five 
on each side.  Each storage rooms can store a full harvest from a single module each day, 21 pallets 
(2,040 kg) of lettuce.  
The rooms have to maintain a minimum temperature of 2Ã‚Â°C and a relative humidity between 90 - 95 %.  
A second exit allows product to be transported from the cold storage to transport trucks.   A small 
vestibule of three meters is between the cold storage rooms and the truck gate.  The vestibule cre
ates an air buffer between the outside and the refrigerated area, which will minimize the inflow of 
warm air into the cold storage area. 

Outside the core area are large water buffer tanks and CO2 tanks which serve the various cultivation 
modules.

## 2.3 Cultivation module description

on the low floor,the module houses the bulk nutrient solution storage (NDS) tank and mixing unit, a 
germination room, the module airlock and a packaging room as well as the utility lines connected to 
the central hub.

On top of the germination room, airlock and NDS room the air management, thermal, power control 
and distribution system components are housed. Detailed descriptions of each of the 
subsystems and their respective components are in the dedicated subsystem chapters in this report. 
The production area is divided into the working area, containing the nurseries, and the cultivation 
area, where the growth racks are placed.  The working space measures four meters 
in length.  Here, the workers have space to harvest, clean and plant gutters which will then be trans
ported to their appropriate areas for the start of the growth cycle.  This area will additionally provide 
space for the workers to package the incoming produce to be shipped away.  The two nurseries are 
located near the core and measure 3 m wide by 13 m long and are stacked five layers high.  The total 
nursery area per module is therefore 390 m2.

The cultivation area contains five gutter growth racks, with each rack being 50 m long and 5 m wide . 
The total height of the growth rack is 6 m, which is the entire floor-to-ceiling 
height in the cultivation area.  Each rack is divided into five, 1 m high growing compartments. The 
compartments are each equipped with a drain, an irrigation pipe with individual drippers, and at the 
top of each compartment, LED panels are placed.

The lettuce heads will be in 5 m long gutters, moving on the growth track.  
The germination room, located in the core of the lettuce module, will be the starting point for 
seeding.  Following successful germination, the young seedlings move to the nurseries in the work 
area of the lettuce module.  The lettuce is transplanted from the nursery into the gutters upon 
maturity.  Lettuce plants are planted 15 cm apart, allowing 33 plants per gutter.

# 3.0 Horticulture Procedures 

The total life cycle for lettuce is 48 days from the seed to harvest.  Germination takes place in the 
germination rooms under germination specific conditions.  The seedlings then spend 
14 days in the nurseries before they are transplanted out into the main gutter growth system.  
Lettuce will spend a total of 28 days maturing in the primary gutter system.  These 28 days are divid
ed up into three distinct phases differing mainly in light intensities.  Each of the five 
levels within the five cultivation racks (see Figure 3-7) will act as an independent growing system 
containing all the necessary lighting conditions to produce fully mature lettuce as they move down 
the length of the grow rack.  Mature head of lettuce are ready to harvest when it reaches an edible 
fresh weight of approximately 200 g.

Plants from the nurseries are transplanted into the gutters by workers, with the facility running at full 
capacity, they will need to replant 308 gutters per module per day.  Gutters are 5 m in length and 0,1 m in width.  Plants 
are spaced 0,15 m from center of planting hole to center of the following planting hole.  This spacing 
allows for thirty-three plants to be planted per gutter.   
Plants will mature and be ready for daily harvest in twelve gutter batches.  Each day workers will 
collect gutters from each growth rack level and replace at the other end with newly transplanted 
gutters.  The gutters in the level then shift up to fill the space created by the dayÂ´s harvest.   
Growth phase 1 is 12.2 m long and has gutters packed with no spacing be
tween them, resulting in a plant density of 66 pl/m2.  This stage will last for a total of ten days.  Fol
lowing this stage the gutters will move into the middle section, which is 
15,7 m long and has the gutters spaced at 5 cm, which results in a plant density of 44 pl/m2.  This 
stage lasts nine days.  The third and final stage, is 22 m long and increases 
the spacing between the gutters to 10 cm resulting in a final harvesting density of 33 pl/m2.  The gut
ters spend a total of nine days in this section before they are ready to be harvested. 

This level of production will produce a maximum of 2,029.5 kg of edible mass per day per module.  This level of production will allow each 
square meter of growing area to produce 146.5 kg of edible produce per year per module.  Calculating the Harvest 
Index (HI) of a crop looks at the ratio of edible mass to the inedible mass.  For lettuce the HI is 0,85, 
assuming a uniform distribution of cellular water, this will result in the production of 304.4 kg of inedi
ble mass per day per module.  
The lettuce is packed in boxes of 0,24 m2 (dimensions 40 x 60 x 20 cm), each box contains twelve 
heads of lettuce.  There will be four boxes arranged in a standard EPAL pallet (80 cm x 120 cm).  Each 
box will weigh approximately 2,4 kg, and will be stacked twelve boxes high.  This results in a total of 
forty boxes per pallet, with a total pallet weight of 96 kg.  The total production will be approximately 
twenty one pallets per day per module.  Inedible matter is sent to the central hub through a chute to be pro
cessed outside the project. 
Gutters are washed following each use using a mobile gutter washing system to keep them free from 
any buildup of algae or other biological waste/growth that could promote plant pathogens from en
tering the facility.

# 4.0 Nutrient Delivery System 

This section describes the Nutrient Delivery System (NDS)>. The irrigation method used is a Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) system.   A detailed description of the nutrient flow in the cultivation system is given for each of the modules.  All calculations and requirements are based on the capturing of water produced during crop transpiration; all transpired water is reclaimed through dehumidification in the air management system and sent back into the system. 

## 4.1  Baseline Design 

The system was developed to be a closed loop design.  Located in the core of each 
module is the subsystem.  Water from the fresh water tank with the addition of the water reclaimed 
from plant transpiration is pumped into the stock solution tanks (Solution A Tank and Solution B 
Tank).  A Priva Nutrijet system  is utilized to control the flow of water from the fresh 
water tank, the addition of solutions from both tank A and B and the acid and base control to ensure 
an optimal nutrient solution in the Mixing Tank.  By using two stock solutions (A and B) the nutrient 
balance can be maintained for a longer period of time.  Electric Conductivity (EC) and pH sensors are 
placed at the junction of the incoming fresh water and the mixing tank of the injection system to 
assess fresh water quality.  These sensors are also placed in a separate loop coming from the mixing 
tank before the nutrients are distributed to the cultivation system to ensure the proper dosage.  
Sand and fine filters are placed before the distribution and a flow meter is used to make sure the 
system is working correctly.  

<p align="center">
  <figcaption >Figure 3: Diagram of the nutrient delivery system of the modules </figcaption>
  <img src="figures\figure_3.JPG" alt="Alt text" width="auto">
</p>

After irrigating the plants, the nutrient solution is pumped through UV sterilization treatment and 
into distributed nutrient solution buffer tanks.  The incoming fresh water only tops off distributed 
nutrient solution buffer tanks which empty slowly through plant activity and any leaks or grower 
activities.  The bulk solution tanks and mixing computer system are placed in the NDS room located 
in the core of the module, clean access (from inside the plant growth area) is provided to this room. 
The two fresh water tanks in the central hub are set to be 150 m3 to allow for expansion of modular production of the 
Vertical Farm without new investment, which supplies enough fresh water needed for all the initial 
modules. 

The baseline nutrient solution is designed following comprehensive analyses of the supply water to 
factor in native minerals and pH levels.   Over time, the nutrient solution inside the system will be
come unbalanced.  The rate of nutrient absorption by the plants may change for different ions, and 
the lack of individual ions cannot be restored using a dual stock solution system.  This can be solved 
by analyzing the time it takes for an important imbalance in the nutrient solution to occur and flush
ing the system completely. The nutrient solution is restored approximately every six months.

### 4.1.1 Gutter System, Lettuce, Irrigation 

The initial calculations for the irrigation needs of the system were based on the transpiration rate of 
the mature crop.  For a fully grown lettuce, the transpiration rate is 3 liter per m2 per day, and a wa
ter buffer of 27 liter per m2 per day was assumed.  For a 5.000 m2 cultivation area, this amounts to 
150 m3 per day or 30 liter per m2 per day for each lettuce module.  The distributed nutrient solution 
tanks are 75m3 (75,000 liter) per module. 
Each growth rack is divided into five growth levels of one meter each, each equipped with a drain 
and an irrigation pipe with individual drippers.  Irrigation is suspended above each 
channel to allow for mobility of the gutters.  Drainage channels leading to the reservoirs are present 
underneath the drain side to capture the solution.  Each grow unit has a dedicated 
845 W pump for irrigation, with an irrigation cycle of 5 minutes on, 10 minutes off, throughout the 
day.  By staggering irrigation cycles between racks, it allows for a smaller distributed nutrient solu
tion tank size. 
Each of the dripper manifolds was assumed to work with 2 bars of pressure at the inlet and was sized 
at 16/13.6 mm (outer/inner diameter).  Pressure losses due to elbows and tee flows are taken into 
account.  The maximum velocity inside the pipes was 2.2 m/s and a design pressure of 1.72 bar was 
used.  The calculation resulted in a 2 meter distribution inlet line per rack of 69.5 mm Ã˜ (2 Â½ inch) 
and 1 meter sections of 84.6 mm Ã˜ (3 inch) and 108 mm Ã˜ (4 inch) each.  The main distribution line 
pressure and velocity allows for the use of only 108 mm Ã˜ (4 inch) pipes, approximately 50 meters 
long. The return pipe length was estimated in 60 meters.


## 5.0 Illumination System 

The analysis of the lighting system is of great importance. It significantly affects the 
energy consumption of the project, both due to the quantity of lights and duration of the photoper
iod, and due to its effects on the thermal load within the project.Lighting design influences the 
photosynthesis rate of the crop, which impacts the final marketable yield. This section addresses the 
types of lighting systems required for the illumination of the crops the resulting energy loads on the project.
The assumed photoperiod for the calculations is 18 hours.  

## 5.1  Baseline Design 

The lights should provide optimal lighting conditions 
without disturbing the optimal climatic conditions of the plant; a rise in temperature near the plant 
canopy due to heat from the lighting system needs to be avoided.  The light selected as a model for 
these features is the Heliospectra LightBar V101G-L .  It is optimized for water cooling 
and specifically developed for VF applications.  It produces a light spectrum specially designed to 
optimize photosynthesis.  Its dimensions are 1235 x 56 x 62 mm and its power consumption is ap
proximately 125 W at normal operation, a capitaly more expensive but operationally cheaper approache would be the
DYNA C9 model or MITRA X Flex which is more than twice as efficient, thus fewer units would be needed.

The lamps should be placed at 0,25 m from the top of the plant canopy.  For the first section of the growth level, where the plants are in the early development stage (day 0-10), the lighting system should provide 200 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 of Photosynthetically Active 
Radiation (PAR), defined as light available for photosynthesis between the wavelengths of 400-700 
nm, and 30 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 of Far Infrared Radiation (FIR). Throughout the middle section of the growth 
levels, where the plants are in the second phase of development , the lighting system should provide 225 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 PAR and 34 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 FIR.  
For the final section of the growth levels, where the plants reach maturity (day 19-28), the lighting system should provide 250 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 PAR   
only. The lighting system layout is designed with sets of four light bars when usin V101G-L, which are mounted end to end, perpendicular 
to the length of the growth rack Each level of the growth rack contains 70 sets of lights, thus there is 
a set of lights every 0,71 m.  Each set is powered by an Artesyn â„¢ LCC 600 watt conduction cooled 
AC-DC power supply.

Each light set is supplied with 500 W to power the lights, which adds to 35000 W per level in each 
growth rack.  Each growth rack has five grow levels with lights; the total power demand for each 
cultivation rack is 175 kW.  The total power needed for the whole cultivation area is 880 kW.   Ap
proximately 40% of the heat is dissipated by the liquid cooling (352 kW), the rest is radiated to the 
surrounding air (528 kW). 
The nurseries use a separate lighting system which provides 150 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 PAR, with a power con
sumption of 37.5 kW.  This brings the total power consumption for the  production module to 
917.5 kW.  



# 8 Air Management & Thermal Control System 

The air management and thermal system are required to maintain the optimal conditions for crop 
growth.  Its design can impact the cost of a VF due to its effects on energy consumption.  It relates to 
several other subsystems, e.g., nutrient delivery and illumination, water and heat recovery.  A de
tailed description of the energy consumption of the system and estimations of the flow rate are giv
en in this section.  The goals of the design are to optimize the energy balance between energy gener
ators and energy users to ensure optimal growing conditions for each crop. 
In a normal Heat Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system, the air is provided by air handling 
equipment which receives air from outside the building, and air recirculated from the inner space. 
The outside and return air are mixed in the mixing chamber, filtered, treated, and delivered to inner 
areas through metal ducts. These metal ducts discharge the air into the inner space, usually through 
supply air diffusers located at the end of the ducts.  In VF 2.0, the air handling equipment located in 
the core of each module is a heat pump, which cold buffer for storage can transport the thermal 
energy removed from the growing compartment to a hot or (see Figure 8-1).  This will allow for the 
reuse of energy obtained from the removed heat from the plant compartments to be used as heating 
for the ground floor or core areas. The buffer also contains the energy from the cooling lines of the 
LED cooling system.
