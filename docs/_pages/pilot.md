# 4.0 Vertical Farm Nutrient Delivery System

### Description
The Nutrient Delivery System (NDS) is a critical component of the vertical farm. It includes stainless steel tanks, piping, controllers, sensors, and actuators. The system will be integrated with a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system using VTScada for real-time monitoring and control.



## 4.1 System Overview
The nutrient delivery system is designed to automate the preparation, storage, and distribution of nutrient solutions for a three-level vertical farm. The system ensures precise control of nutrient composition and delivery timing, optimizing plant growth and resource efficiency. It consists of two primary tanks:
1. **Tank A (Mixing Tank)**: Prepares the nutrient solution by filtering, adjusting electrical conductivity (EC), and pH levels.
2. **Tank B (Reservoir Tank)**: Stores the prepared solution and delivers it to the vertical farm during scheduled feeding cycles.

The system operates on a **8-minute cycle**, divided into two phases:
1. **Mixing Phase (5 minutes)**: Tank A prepares the nutrient solution by filtering used water, adding fertilizers based on EC readings, and adjusting pH using acid or base solutions.
2. **Pumping Phase (3 minutes)**: The prepared solution is pumped from Tank A to Tank B at a flow rate of 0.8 L/s.

During this process, Tank B continuously pumps the solution to the vertical farm unit. Each level of the farm receives nutrient solution for **5 minutes**, followed by a **10-minute rest period**, controlled by solenoid valves to ensure only one level is fed at a time.



## 4.2 Key Design Considerations

### 4.2.1 Nutrient Solution Preparation
- **EC Measurement**: Fertilizer is added to the solution based on real-time EC readings to maintain optimal nutrient concentration.
- **pH Adjustment**: Acid or base solutions are dosed to achieve the desired pH level, ensuring nutrient availability and plant health.
- **Water Source**: Used water from the previous cycle is filtered and reused. If insufficient, reverse osmosis (RO) water is added to achieve the required volume.

### 4.2.2 Cycle Timing and Efficiency
- The **10-minute cycle** (5 minutes mixing + 5 minutes pumping) was determined to be the most appropriate when the mixing time was set to 5 minutes based on flow rate and tank volume calculations, but to give leeway to for correction incase of operational errors, the **8 minute cycle** (5 minutes mixing + 3 minutes pumping) was selected.
- **Figure 6** illustrate the relationship between flow rate, tank volume, and cycle timing, confirming the optimal cycle duration.

  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pilot_images/determining_cycle_time.JPG"  style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>
</div>
</div>

- once the mixing time was set, and the cycle time was found, the tanks sizes A and B wre interpolated and used to draw the tank accordingly. **Figure 7** bellow shows the expected cycle for further clarification.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pilot_images/refill_cycle_error_handling.JPG"  style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
  </p>
</div>
</div>

### 4.2.3 Tank Sizing and Engineering
- Using the volumes of Tank A and Tank B that were determined earlier, and with the help of engineering principles guidelines for mixing tanks, the dimensions of the tanks were drawn to scale, shown in **Figure 9** below. Examples of the principles used are:
  - The height-to-diameter ratio of 1-1.5 for efficient axial reach.
  - The position, number, and type of blade (in our case, a **hydrofoil**) for a low-viscosity, non-solid suspended fluid.
  - Lining of the tank with flaps to prevent vortex formation at a protrusion depth of 0.1-0.12 times the diameter of the tank.
  - A bottom dome to prevent stagnation areas.
  - Height redundancy to prevent spillage and a buffer allowance at the flaps to encourage laminar flow at the surface of the solution.



  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; text-align: center;">
    <div>
    <p >
      <figcaption><b>Figure 9:</b> Tanks A and B final render </figcaption>
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pilot_images/tanks_final_v2.jpg"  style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
    </p>
    </div>
  </div>


- Tank heights were measured to account for **head pressure loss due to elevation**, which influences pump selection, pipe selection and system performance that will be reviewed next.

### 4.2.4 Pipe Sizing and Pressure Loss

  To ensure efficient flow rates and minimal energy consumption, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to account for pressure losses arising from **pipe length**, **friction**, **joints**, and elevation changes. These factors were derived from the design layout established during the construction phase. Additionally, the dimensions of the tanks, as designed in earlier stages, and the material properties selected for the system were carefully incorporated into the analysis to guarantee reliable and accurate results.

  The flow rate at the pipe network outlet to the gutter system was calculated and fixed as a constant during the **fluid mechanics** analysis. This resulted in a clear relationship between **pipe diameter** and **pump size**. To visualize this relationship, a graph was generated for each pipe, considering only those diameters readily available in the market. This graph served as a critical tool for selecting the most suitable pipe and associated pump ratings, ensuring that the chosen components would operate harmoniously and cost-effectively to achieve the desired performance at the lowest cost possible. Below is the result for each of the pipes/pipe systems.

  - **Pump Specifications**:
    - Efficiency: 80%
    - Power: 30.35 W


  ### Reservoir to Gutter Units

  - The pipe network from reservoir Tank B to the gutter units involves multiple connections and pipe diameters.
  - Calculations were performed similarly, but with additional complexity due to the branching network, here the first pipe is called pipe A with subsequent branching following the pattern alphabetically.
  - since the outlet pipes are directly related to required flow rate and the gutter inlet opening, its diameter and solution speed were set as constants respectively.

# 9.0 Nutrient solution compounds
### Description
in the following, we shall break down the required compounds for the production of lettuce and use the data to find a suitable fertilizer

## 9.1 Nutrient Requirements/ Fertilization

Lettuce requires a well-balanced nutrient solution containing:
- Nitrogen (N) - for leafy growth
- Phosphorus (P) - for root development
- Potassium (K) - for plant vigor and disease resistance
- Calcium (Ca) - to prevent tip burn
- Magnesium (Mg) - essential for chlorophyll production
- Micronutrients such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and boron (B)
- The EC (Electrical Conductivity) of the nutrient solution should be maintained at 1.2 - 2.0 mS/cm, and the pH should be adjusted to 5.5 - 6.5 for optimal nutrient uptake.

<table >
 <caption style=' text-align: center; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 20px;'> <b>Table 11:</b>  Macro-nutrient composition and concentrations detected in supplemental water and a nutrient solution with EC of 1.8 mS·cm−1 and pH of 5.8 for hydroponic production of Butterhead lettuce.</caption>

Based on the **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) ratios** obtained from the practical data in **Table 11**, an **NPK ratio** of **129.18 | 48.32 | 183.23** or **2.673 | 1 | 3.794** was determined. Given the availability of water-soluble fertilizers suitable for hydroponics, a standard **3 | 1 | 4** ratio can be used.  

Each head of lettuce requires **5 liters** of water throughout its life cycle. In the pilot-scale project, **2,450 heads** of lettuce are evenly distributed over **75 m²**, resulting in a total water usage of **12,250 liters**.  

Several commercially available fertilizers meet the required NPK ratio, with a **maximum cost of $20 per kg**, including **Sulfur (S), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), and various micronutrients**.  

**Note:** The fertilizer referenced represents the highest quality and most premium option. For the full-scale project, a **custom-blended formulation** will be produced in-house by the **resident professor of agriculture**, at a cost approximately **five times lower**.  

Given the total water requirement, the amount of fertilizer needed is:  
12,250 L ÷ 1,000 = 12.25 kg  ==> 13kg

## 9.2 Cost Breakdown

- The total fertilizer cost at the premium price point would be:  
<p style="text-align: center;">13 Kg × 20 $/Kg = <strong>USD 260 </strong></p>

- 2475 lettuce seed are required. the most suitable size available on the market is the 5000 seed bag of premium Salanova Expertise RZ lettuce at <strong>USD 280</strong>.


- The cost of 250 Rockwool Plugs is USD 10. 13 packs should suffice with a little extra for contingency, totaling  **USD 130**

# 10. Profit Projections

### Description

In the following analysis, the projected profits for both the pilot-scale and main-scale projects will be estimated by considering four key operating costs:

- **Plant seeds and nutrients** (with Neutralizers)
- **Electricity**
- **Overheads**

Since most of these costs have already been estimated, the next step is simply to compile the figures and distribute them across the 75 m² of lettuce production in the pilot-scale setup.

**Note:** The attached video (also available <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pilot_images/static_vs_dynamic.mp4" download="static_vs_dynamic.mp4">Here</a>) illustrates the key differences between batch-based lettuce production (pilot scale) and a conveyor belt system (main scale). While batch production is ahead by one complete plant life cycle, this advantage is outweighed by logistical benefits. A continuous daily supply of smaller lettuce increments, rather than a full harvest every 42 days, simplifies sales operations and optimizes storage space.
Additionally, using conveyor systems in series allows for dynamic spacing between NFT gutters. Initially, the gutters are placed closely together since young lettuce plants require minimal space. As the conveyor moves forward, the spacing gradually increases, ensuring optimal use of the growing area. In contrast, static batch production requires gutters to be positioned at their maximum spacing from the start, even when the plants are still in the early growth stages. This makes the conveyor system a more space-efficient approach.

#### Plant seeds and nutrients
- The cost of 5000 seed bag of premium Salanova Expertise RZ lettuce is USD 280 , with 33 heads per square meter, the price contribution per m² is **USD 1.848**.

- The cost of 250 Rockwool Plugs is USD 10, thus the price per head is $0.04. with 33 heads per m², the contributed cost stands at **USD 1.32**

- The cost estimate for of th far end highest quality grade pre-made fertilizer came to $245 for 2,450 Lettuce heads encompassing 75 m², bringing th price per area to **USD 3.267**.

#### Electricity

##### Total Power Consumption per Hour:
- Each LED light consumes 88 watts.
- Total power for 42 lights:

<p style="text-align: center;">42 lights × 88 watts = 3,696 watts = 3.696 kW</p>


##### Daily energy consumption:
- The lights run for 14 hours per day.
- Daily energy consumption:

<p style="text-align: center;">3.696 kW × 14 hours = 51.744 kWh/day</p>

##### Total Energy Consumption Over 42 Days
- Total energy consumption:

<p style="text-align: center;">51.744 kWh/day × 42 days = 2,173.248 kWh</p>

##### Total Electricity Cost
- Electricity rate: ₦209.5/kWh.
-  Total cost:

<p style="text-align: center;">2,173.248 kWh × 209.5 ₦/kWh = <Strong>₦ 455,295.46</Strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Price per Area = <Strong>₦ 6,070.6</Strong></p>

#### Overheads
The Employee salary above wont chang much since during the main project since these are specialized personnel while the rest of the staff are mostly Labourers or in the security team. for safety purposes, 100% cost shall still be added on top of the current monthly expenditure of ₦ 1,590,000, bringing the sum of salaries per month to ₦ 3,180,000 or per a complete cycle (48 days) to **₦ 5,088,000**.

- The are used here will be the total area of the main project mentioned above at 25,000 m² 
<p style="text-align: center;">Price per Area (scaled)= <Strong>₦ 203.52</Strong></p>

</table>

- With the current Exchange rate of 1,500 as of the time of writing,the total NGN cost per m² stands at ₦ 15,926.62, or ₦ 482.62 per Lettuce head.
- on the other end, during production when we are fully reliant on solar energy, the Electricity bill could very well be nill, and with our own fertilizer mixture at 5x lower in terms of cost, final cost per m² will become ₦ 5,935.62, or **₦ 179.87** per Premium Lettuce head.

### Projections

- with a base cost of **₦ 179.87** per Lettuce head, adding a redundancy of 25% for Logistics and maintenance, we arrive at a usable cost estimate of **₦224.8** per head.
- The retail price of local lettuce varies at about ₦500, with retail atr about ₦400. lets assume the company is willing to sell our premium product at the same retail price so we can penetrate the market, profit is about **₦175.2** or **43.8%**.
- The large scales total conveyor system is Exactly 25,000 m² with a  daily production of 1,240 NFT gutters and 33 heads per gutter thus the total profit per month is **₦215,075,520** or **$143,383.68**.
